    "text": "Jim Kwik: learn anything faster\nTo learn anything faster, just remember FAST\n\nThe F in Fast stands for Forget\n\nIf you want to speed up ‘kwik brain,’ you must temporarily forget three things.\nForget what you already know about the subject. A lot of people don’t learn faster because they feel like they already know the information. But your mind is like a parachute—it only works when it’s open.\nForget about anything that’s not urgent and important. You can’t multitask. If your brain is thinking about 4 different things, you’re not fully present and you won’t learn ’kwik’ly.\nForget your limitations. These are beliefs like your memory isn’t good, or you’re a slow reader, or you don’t have the right education to learn. But if you fight for your limitations, you get to keep them. Your memory isn’t fixed, and it is possible to remember hundreds of words and numbers the way I do onstage.\n\n\n\nThe A in FAST stands for Active\n\nIn school, we were taught to learn by consuming information quietly. But you don’t learn by being lectured to. You learn by creating information and being active in the process.\nLearning is NOT a spectator sport.\nHow can you be more active in your learning?\nAsk questions.\nTake notes.\nThe more active you are, the more you will learn.\n\n\n\nThe S in FAST stands for State\n\nYour state is a snapshot of your mood – the mood of your mind and your body. It’s the emotional well-being that you feel in that exact moment.\nInformation combined with emotion becomes a long-term memory.\nMany of us don’t remember what we learned in school because the umbrella emotion for most people in school was boredom.\nYou are the only person in control of your state.\nHow can you improve your state?\nChange your posture or your body or breathing.\nSit or stand the way you would if you were totally energized.\nThink about how you’ll benefit from the information.\nAll learning is state-dependent. Choose states of joy, fascination, and curiosity.\nSell your cleverness for bewilderment – Rumi.\n\n\n\nThe T in FAST stands for Teach\n\nIf you want to cut your learning curve in half, learn with the intention of teaching it to somebody else.\nIf you had to give a presentation on what you’re learning today, you would learn it differently. You would pay closer attention. You would take more detailed notes. You would ask better questions.\nWhen I teach something, I get to learn it twice.\nPeople often say that those who can’t do teach. But I never saw that as a negative. I always thought, wow, if I can’t do something, I can teach it, and then I can do it."

It is commonly used on the web to format blog posts and other types of content.\nVisualCode is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is used to write and debug code.\nGitHub Pages is a service offered by the popular version control platform GitHub. It allows users to create and host websites using the files that are stored in their GitHub repositories. It can be used to create personal, organization, or project-based websites.\n\n\nGit\nGit is a version control system that is used for tracking changes to files, such as source code or documents. It is commonly used by software developers to manage their codebase, but it can also be used for other types of files.\n\nGit allows users to create a repository, which is a collection of files that are managed by Git. Each time a change is made to a file in the repository, Git records the change in a new version of the file. This allows users to easily undo changes, compare different versions of a file, and collaborate with others on the same files.\n\nGit also provides tools for managing and merging changes made by different users. This makes it possible for multiple people to work on the same files at the same time without overwriting each other’s changes.\nOverall, Git is a powerful and widely-used tool that is essential for anyone working on large or complex projects with multiple collaborators. It allows users to easily track, manage, and share changes to their files, making it easier to develop and maintain software projects."

    "text": "What DevOps Isn’t\nGiven that DevOps is a philosophy… a management approach… and the combination of multiple IT disciplines… it might be easier to quickly look at some of what it isn’t.\n\nDevOps is not Agile. That said, your teams might indeed use Agile as a development methodology within an overall DevOps-style approach. Agile is certainly DevOps-compatible, and, like DevOps, values short, continual improvement.\nDevOps is not Continuous Integration. That said, CI is often a part of DevOps-style behavior. The two can be really closely related, in fact - so closely that it’s hard to tell the difference. I suppose you could argue that it’s difficult to practice the DevOps philosophy without using CI as an enabling implementation, but you can definitely have CI without behaving like a DevOps organization, so the two aren’t exactly the same thing.\nDevOps isn’t “the developers running Operations.” If anything, it’s Operations automating things to the point where Operations runs itself in response to authorized actions taken by other roles, including developers.\nDevOps isn’t a software development methodology. See the first bullet, above. DevOps is what happens while software development is happening, and largely what happens when software development (or a cycle of it), is done. You still need to manage your software development - you just need to use a methodology that’s DevOps-compatible.\nDevOps is not automation. However, you can’t have DevOps without automation. Automation is perhaps the biggest thing that Operations brings to the DevOps table, in fact.\n\n\nFurther, it actually seems to be an unstated goal of many DevOps champions to avoid the creation of any kind of trademarked, rigid, rulebook of “how to do DevOps,” as ITIL or TQM or something. This book certainly doesn’t attempt to provide “rules;” the goal here is to provide some understanding of what DevOps’ broad goals are.\n\nDevOps by DevOps Training"

This allows the Java compiler to catch type errors before the program is executed, making it easier to find and fix errors in your code.\nStrong: Java has a strong type system, which means that type conversions (also known as typecasting) between different types are not allowed unless they are explicitly specified by the programmer.

For example:\n// Create a new Person and Account\nAccountManager manager = AccountManager.getInstance();\nmanager.person = new Person(\"John Doe\", \"123 Main St.\");\nmanager.person = new Person(\"Carla Jameson\", \"323 Main St.\");\nmanager.person = new Person(\"Rafael Martin\", \"3 Glorious St.\");\nmanager.person = new Person(\"Pau Vila\", \"63 Sesamo St.\");"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Java SE Basic Principles OOP\n\n\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code that manipulates that data. OOP is based on several key principles, including the following:\n\nEncapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the idea of combining data and the code that manipulates that data into a single unit, or object. This allows for better organization and modularity of code, and helps to hide the internal details of an object from other parts of the program.\nAbstraction: Abstraction is the process of representing essential features without including the details. In OOP, abstraction is often achieved through the use of interfaces or abstract classes, which define a set of common methods that can be implemented by different classes in different ways. This allows for greater flexibility and reusability of code.\nInheritance: Inheritance is the ability of a class to inherit the attributes and behaviors of another class. In OOP, a class can inherit from a parent class, also known as a superclass, and can override or extend the methods of the parent class to add new functionality. This allows for code reuse and makes it easier to create hierarchies of classes.\nPolymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In OOP, polymorphism allows for the use of a single interface to refer to objects of different types. This allows for greater flexibility and code reuse, as the same method can be used on objects of different types and the appropriate implementation will be called based on the type of the object.\n\nOverall, the principles of encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism are fundamental to OOP and form the basis for many of its benefits, such as modularity, flexibility, code reuse, and ease of maintenance.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample object in Java\n\n\nIn object-oriented programming (OOP), an object is a self-contained unit that combines data and the code that manipulates that data.\nAn object is a data structure that contains:\n\nattributes, or properties, that describe the object, defines the state’s object\nand methods, or functions, that define the behavior of the object.\n\nObjects can interact with each other by sending and receiving messages, or method calls, to access and modify their data.\nObjects are created from classes, which are templates that define the structure and behavior of objects.\nIn Java, objects are created using the new keyword, and their attributes and methods can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Objects are an important concept in OOP and are central to many of its benefits, such as modularity, code reuse, and flexibility.\n\nPerson carla = new Person(\"Carla\", 21, \"red hair\", 45.000);\n\n\n\nIn object-oriented programming (OOP):\n\nThe constructor is a special type of method that is used to create and initialize an object. In Java, a constructor is a method that has the same name as the class and is used to create an instance of the class. A constructor can take arguments, which are used to initialize the object’s attributes, or properties.\nThe state of an object refers to the values of its attributes at a given moment in time.\nThe behavior of an object refers to the actions or operations that it can perform. In Java, the behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are functions that are associated with the object and can be called to perform actions on the object.\n\nOverall, a constructor, state, and behavior are important concepts in OOP and are closely related.\nA constructor is used to create and initialize an object, and its state and behavior are defined by its attributes and methods, respectively. In Java SE, these concepts are central to the creation and use of objects, and are fundamental to the flexibility and power of the Java language."

    "text": "The singleton pattern is a design pattern in computer programming and Java that is used to restrict the instantiation of a class to one “single” instance.\n\n\nThis is useful when you want to make sure that only one object of a particular class is created, because this can be helpful for managing resources and ensuring that your program is running as efficiently as possible.\nIn Java, the singleton pattern can be implemented by creating a private constructor for the class, which prevents other objects from creating instances of the class.\nThe class also typically provides a static method that allows other classes to access the single instance of the class, which is created the first time the static method is called. This ensures that only one instance of the class is created, and that all other classes can access this instance easily.\n\n\n\nSingleton Pattern"

CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.\nCSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.\nAfter CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.\nreference: CSS: Cascading Style Sheets"

When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.\nFor example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., this text is bold). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.

    "text": "How Does it Work?\nDillinger makes writing in Markdown easy because it hides the stuff happening behind the scenes, but it’s worth exploring how the process works in general.\nWhen you write in Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an .md or .markdown extension. But then what? How is your Markdown-formatted file converted into HTML or a print-ready document?\nThe short answer is that you need a Markdown application capable of processing the Markdown file. There are lots of applications available — everything from simple scripts to desktop applications that look like Microsoft Word. Despite their visual differences, all of the applications do the same thing. Like Dillinger, they all convert Markdown-formatted text to HTML so it can be displayed in web browsers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown processor\n\n\n\nMarkdown applications use something called a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a “parser” or an “implementation”) to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. At that point, your document can be viewed in a web browser or combined with a style sheet and printed. You can see a visual representation of this process below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown app\n\n\n\nThe Markdown application and processor are two separate components. For the sake of brevity, I’ve combined them into one element (“Markdown app”) in the figure below. The Markdown Process\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Does it Work?\n\n\nTo summarize, this is a four-part process:\n\nCreate a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application. The file should have an .md or .markdown extension.\nOpen the Markdown file in a Markdown application.\nUse the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document.\nView the HTML file in a web browser or use the Markdown application to convert it to another file format, like PDF.\n\nFrom your perspective, the process will vary somewhat depending on the application you use. For example, Dillinger essentially combines steps 1-3 into a single, seamless interface — all you have to do is type in the left pane and the rendered output magically appears in the right pane. But if you use other tools, like a text editor with a static website generator, you’ll find that the process is much more visible."

Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.\nHTML uses “markup” to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special “elements” such as\n<head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, \n<div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>,\n<embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>\nand many others.\nAn HTML element is set off from other text in a document by tags, which consist of the element name surrounded by < and >. The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way.

For example, here we read and plot a CSV of NOAA’s Monthly CO2 concentration data from Mauna Loa:\n\n\ndata = {\n  const co2data = await FileAttachment(\"co2_mm.csv\")\n    .csv({ typed: true } );\n  return co2data.map(d => {\n    d[\"decimal date\"] = Number(d[\"decimal date\"]);\n    d.average = Number(d.average);\n    return d;\n  });\n}\nPlot.plot({\n  marks: [\n    Plot.line(data,\n      { x: \"decimal date\", y: \"average\"},\n      { stroke: \"black\" }\n    )\n  ]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython and R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython and R The data you want to use with OJS might not always be available in raw form. Often you’ll need to read and preprocess the raw data using Python or R. You can perform this preprocessing during document render (in an {r} or {python} code cell) and then make it available to {ojs} cells via the ojs_define() function. Here’s an example. We’ll read the same data into R, do some grouping and summarization, then make it available to OJS using ojs_define:\n\n\n#| output: false\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nco2 = read_csv(\"co2_mm.csv\")  %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarize(max = max(average))\n\nojs_define(co2data = co2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb APIs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb APIs You can use the d3.json() function to read JSON data from web services and data sources. Here we query the GitHub API for data on contributions to the Python pandas package:\n\n\nd3 = require('d3')\n\ncontributors = await d3.json(\n  \"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/stats/contributors\"\n)\n\ncommits = contributors.map(contributor => {\n  const author = contributor.author;\n  return {\n    name: author.login,\n    title: author.login,\n    group: author.type,\n    value: contributor.total\n  }\n})"

Additionally, they will need to use GitHub and Visual Code** to manage their project’s code and collaborate with their peers. \n\n\n  Tasks\n\n\nThe tasks involved in this project include: \n\n\nIn the first part of the project, students will create a basic web page using markdown and publish it on Github repository using Visual Code. This will involve creating a new repository on Github and learning how to use markdown to format text and create links.\n\n\nIn the second part of the project, students will learn how to publish their website on gh-pages, a service provided by Github for hosting static websites. This will involve learning how to use the gh-pages service and how to deploy their website to the internet.\n\n\n\nYou should check your website on user/github.io/repo.\n\n\n\n  Optional\n\n\nAs an optional study, students may also want to learn about using callouts in their markdown documentation.

To take their project to the next level, students may also choose to connect to an API (Application Programming Interface) to retrieve data and render charts using JavaScript. This will require an understanding of how to make HTTP requests and how to manipulate data in JavaScript.\n\n\nQuarto data sources\n\n\n  After\n\n\nThe Quarto website project is a great opportunity for students to develop their skills in web development, markdown, and version control using GitHub and Visual Code."

This group of statements is treated as one single unit. There are two blocks in the above program. One contains the body of the class Hello. The other contains the body of the main() method. There is no need to put a semi-colon after the closing brace.\nWhitespaces: Blank, tab, and newline are collectively called whitespace. Extra whitespaces are ignored, i.e., only one whitespace is needed to separate the tokens. Nonetheless, extra whitespaces improve the readability, and I strongly suggest you use extra spaces and newlines to improve the readability of your code.\nCase Sensitivity: Java is case sensitive - a ROSE is NOT a Rose, and is NOT a rose.
